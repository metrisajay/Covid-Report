# Covid-Report
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths

I'm thrilled to share a recent data engineering project I've been working on, revolving around the Covid19 dataset! üèÖ
In this project, leveraged the power of Azure Data Factory for Data Ingestion, Azure Data Lake Gen2 for Datalake, Azure Databricks for processing the transformation, and Azure Key Vault for securely accessing the data from Datalake within the Notebook.

Learnings from this project.
1. How to Fetch the Data from Onpremise
2. Building Data Lake using Azure Data Lake Gen 2 
3. Building Data Pipeline using Azure Data Factory 
4. Secure the secrets/credentials using Azure Key Vault 
5. Data Transformation using Azure Databricks

Self hosted Integration:
A self-hosted integration runtime (SHIR) can be used to scan data source in an on-premises network or a virtual network. The installation of a self-hosted integration runtime needs an on-premises machine or a virtual machine inside a private network.
